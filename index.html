        <h2>What worked well for you over the last 9 weeks that aided in your learning process?</h2>
        <p>The main thing that really help me learn the information fro the class was the live demos that you did after lecture. It is difficult for me to be able to read the book to under stand but it is much easy if ic an can see a demonstration then try it for myself and learn from trial and error.</p>
        <h2>What would you change about the course?</h2>
        <p>The only problem i had with the class is with the weeks that we had to cover mutiply chapter those were the weeks that were difficult for me because it was too much information to try to take in at such a short time, but i guess you cant really do anything about that ina 9 week course. </p>
        <h2>Did you learn what you expected to learn in this course? </h2>
        <p>Yeah I did. It pretty cool getting to how website are constructed because now surfing the internet I can imagine what the html and the css for that website would look like and if they are using bootstrap.</p>
        <h2>What concepts were new to you and what concepts had you already encountered in the past?</h2>
        <p>I never had any Experience with Html so, everting that I learn in this class was something knew. </p>
